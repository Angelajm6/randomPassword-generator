# JavaScript Password Generator

## Introduction
I have modified the starter code that has been given to me to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.


## Features
A button to generate a random password
Option for password lenght
Option for lower case and upper case 
option for special characters
Option for numbers


## How to use
Click the red button "Generate password" and follow the instruction that will pop up on top of the webpage. Once all the prompts are answered, your random password will be generated matching the selected criteria. 


## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
